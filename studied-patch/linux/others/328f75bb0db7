    drm/i915: Use intel_panel_actually_set_backlight() to disable PWM backlight
    
    Use intel_panel_actually_set_backlight() instead of a direct
    call to pwm_config() in pwm_disable_backlight().
    
    The main benefit is consistent debug logging when we turn off the
    backlight. Currently we see nothing in dmesg which made me wonder
    whether the backlight was even getting turned off properly.
    
    The second benefit is consistency; This is what we do for all
    the other backlight implementations.
