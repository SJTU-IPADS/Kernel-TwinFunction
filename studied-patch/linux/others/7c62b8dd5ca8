    net/ipv6: lower the level of "link is not ready" messages
    
    This message gets logged far too often for how interesting is it.
    
    Most distributions nowadays configure NetworkManager to use randomly
    generated MAC addresses for Wi-Fi network scans. The interfaces end up
    being periodically brought down for the address change. When they're
    subsequently brought back up, the message is logged, eventually flooding
    the log.
    
    Perhaps the message is not all that helpful: it seems to be more
    interesting to hear when the addrconf actually start, not when it does
    not. Let's lower its level.
