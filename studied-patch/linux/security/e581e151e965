    ASoC: dapm: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
    
    Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
    snprintf causes problems.
    
    1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
    In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
    buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
    uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
    to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
    size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
    
    2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
    space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
    disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
    the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
    size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
    large.  Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED_USERCOPY kernel
    configuration.
    
    The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
    characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
    exceed SIZE.
