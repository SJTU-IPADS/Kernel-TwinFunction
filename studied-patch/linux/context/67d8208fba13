    crypto4xx_core: don't abuse __dma_sync_page
    
    This function is internal to the DMA API implementation. Instead use
    the DMA API to properly unmap. Note that the DMA API usage in this
    driver is a disaster and urgently needs some work - it is missing all
    the unmaps, seems to do a secondary map where it looks like it should
    to a unmap in one place to work around cache coherency and the
    directions passed in seem to be partially wrong.
