# Studied patches + New patches accepted by Linux developers

### new-patch

The 136 patches that are accepted by upstream Linux developers. All patches are submitted by us.

These patches have fixed 320 misuses.

We have anonymized these patches as required by submission rules.

### studied-patch

All the patches that we used for the study, including 437 Linux patches merged into Linux 5.0
and 67 patches merged into FreeBSD 11.2.

All the patches are fixing the problem studied in the paper.

The patches are separated into different directories. Each directory indicates _the factor that decides a misuse_.
For example, linux/security contains all patches where a misused function lacks
necessary security enhancement.

Readers may look into each directory and find all other misuse cases not mentioned in the paper.
